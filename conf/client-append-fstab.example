# This file is for DRBL client to append specific mount point in fstab
# Yo can put local device to be mounted in this file
# The mount point will be created by drblpush.
# The format is just like /etc/fstab
# Ex:
# /dev/hda1 /work1      ext3    defaults        1 2
# In the example, 
# (1) A dir ${drbl_common_root}/work1 will be created in drbl server.
# (2) This line will be appended to client's /etc/fstab
#
# NOTE! NOTE!  NOTE! NOTE!  NOTE! NOTE!  NOTE! NOTE!
# NOTE! You have to create the partition table and format the partition by yourself.
